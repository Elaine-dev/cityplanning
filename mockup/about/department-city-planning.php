	                   <p>We are 340 employees strong. Together, we are the faces of your City Planning Department. Covering 470 square
	                   miles and representing four million residents, we shape the future development of our City and its neighborhoods
	                   through land use policies.</p>
	                   <h3 class="team-heading">What We Do</h3>
	                   <p>We implement the overarching vision that guides the physical development of our City. By reflecting the
	                   collective aspirations of our communities, we enhance and preserve our built environment through long-range
	                   planning.</p>
	                   <h3 class="team-heading">Our Mandate</h3>
	                   <p>We balance the diverse needs that are reflective of our geographically and culturally diverse City. We do so in
		                   order to build consensus and set a clear citywide vision.</p>

	                       <h3 class="team-heading">How We Work</h3>
	                       <p>The Director of Planning reports directly to the Mayor and implements policy at the direction of the City
	                       Council. He manages three bureaus, each overseen by a Deputy Director that work in unison to achieve our common
	                       goals.</p>
	                       <p><strong>The Policy Planning Bureau</strong> develops citywide policies. Through a community-driven
	                       process, staff formulates objectives, policies, and goals to direct the future shape and form of our City as
	                       set by the Mayor and City Council.</p>
	                       <p><strong>The Project Planning Bureau</strong> enforces those policies through the approval process for
	                       development projects. Working alongside the Policy Planning Bureau, staff reviews projects to verify that they
	                       meet certain findings and support the overarching objectives, policies, and goals of the City.</p>
	                       <p><strong>The Resource Management Bureau</strong> provides the technical, administrative, financial and
	                       performance management services that are critical to the success and functioning of the entire
	                       department.</p>
